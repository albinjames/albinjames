<h1 align="center">Hey there!! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

With a PhD in theoretical physics and recently trained in Data Science at the Le Wagon full-time bootcamp Paris, I am passionate about machine
learning and applied mathematics. I am looking for a role as a data analyst/scientist in order to put my know-how into practice in a
professional environment. Industrial and medical applications are particularly interesting to me.

<!--The mechanical and the biomedical engineering sectors are especially attractive to me.-->

My intention is to continue to learn and grow in this ever-changing data landscape!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Heart Murmurs](https://github.com/fablaw/circor), a project to detect heart anomalies using sound signals, i.e. phonocardiograms (PCG)

- ðŸŒ± Currently I am learning **TensorFlow, XGBoost, Complex Wavelet Transforms, and Julia**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **PDEs, Symbolic Python (SymPy), Signal Processing**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **jamesalbin44 at gmail.com** or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albinjames1729/)

- âš¡ "Fun fact" about self: **These days one of my favourite actitivies is doing the groceries. It blends well with an evening walk :)**

<h4 align="center">I look forward to a career in Data Science!</h4>
