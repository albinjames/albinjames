<h1 align="center">Hey there!! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

Trained in Data Science at the Le Wagon full-time bootcamp Paris, and with a PhD in theoretical physics, I am passionate about machine
learning and applied mathematics. I am looking for a role as a data analyst/scientist in order to put my know-how into practice in a
professional environment. Industrial and medical applications are particularly interesting to me.

<!--The mechanical and the biomedical engineering sectors are especially attractive to me.-->

My intention is to continue to learn and grow in this ever-changing data landscape!

- ðŸ¦¬ Iâ€™m currently working on a *Wind Forecasting* project for Jena, Germany (Time series, Support vector regression, Fuzzy inference, Genetic algorithm)

- ðŸŒ± Currently I am learning **TensorFlow, [sktime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime), [Complex Wavelet Transforms](https://people.math.sc.edu/blanco/IMI/DTCWT0.pdf), and [julia](https://julialang.org/learning/tutorials/)**

- ðŸ¤— A group project I was part of during the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/fr/data-science-course): [Heart Murmurs](https://github.com/fablaw/circor), to detect heart anomalies using sound signals, i.e. [phonocardiograms (PCG)](https://physionet.org/content/circor-heart-sound/1.0.3/)

- ðŸ‘¾ Curious about **Bayesian Methods, [Hamiltonian MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo)](https://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/12/19/markov_chain_monte_carlo.html), Probabilistic Programming, Numerical Methods**

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **PDEs, (Symbolic Python (SymPy)](https://www.sympy.org/), Time Series/Signal Processing**

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **james.albin44 at gmail.com**, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albinjames1729/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/albinjames)

- ðŸ˜– A "Fun fact" about myself: These days one of my favourite actitivies is doing the groceries. It blends well with an evening walk and some cool podcasts :)



<h4 align="center">I look forward to a career in Data Science!</h4>
